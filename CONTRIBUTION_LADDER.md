Our ladder defines the roles and responsibilities on this project and how to
participate with the goal of moving from a user to a maintainer. You will need
to gain people's trust, demonstrate your competence and understanding, and meet
the requirements of the role.

## Community Member

Everyone is a community member! ðŸ˜„ You've read this far so you are already ahead. ðŸ’¯

Here are some ideas for how you can be more involved and participate in the community:

* Comment on an issue that youâ€™re interested in.
* Submit a pull request to fix an issue.
* Report a bug.
* Come chat with us in [Slack][https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C014TNCEX8R].

You must follow our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).


## Contributor

[Contributors][contributors] have the following capabilities:

* Have issues and pull requests assigned to you
* Apply labels, milestones and projects
* [Mark issues as duplicates](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests)

### How to become a contributor

To become a contributor, the maintainers of the project would like to see you:

* Comment on issues with your experiences and opinions.
* Add your comments and reviews on pull requests.
* Contribute pull requests.
* Open issues with bugs, enhancement ideas, and questions.

Contributors and maintainers will do their best to watch for community members
who may make good contributors. But donâ€™t be shy, if you feel that this is you,
please reach out to one or more of the contributors or [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md).


## Maintainer

[Maintainers][maintainers] are members with extra capabilities:

* Be a [Code Owner](.github/CODEOWNERS) and have reviews automatically requested.
* Review pull requests.
* Merge pull requests.

Maintainers also have additional responsibilities beyond just merging code:

* Help foster a safe and welcoming environment for all project participants.
  This will include understanding and enforcing our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).
* Organize and promote pull request reviews, e.g. prompting community members,
  contributors, and other maintainers to review.
* Triage issues, e.g. adding labels, promoting discussions, finalizing decisions.
* Help organize our development meetings, e.g. schedule, organize and
  execute agenda.

Maintainers must agree to and follow the [Reviewing Guide](REVIEWING.md).


### How to become a maintainer

To become a maintainer, we would like to see you be an effective
contributor, and show that you can do some of the things maintainers do.
Maintainers will do their best to regularly discuss promoting contributors. But
donâ€™t be shy, if you feel that this is you, please reach out to one or more of
the maintainers.

## Admin

[Admins][admins] are maintainers with extra responsibilities:


* Manage cnf-testsuite repositories
* Manage cnf-testsuite teams
* Manage cnf-testsuite CODEOWNERS file

[admins]: TBD <!-- https://github.com/orgs/getporter/teams/admins -->

### How to become an admin

It isn't expected that all maintainers will need or want to move up to admin. If
you are a maintainer, and find yourself often asking an admin to do certain
tasks for you and you would like to help out with administrative tasks, please
reach out to one or more of the admins.
